Pre-Internet, the odds of data persisting and future generations being able to look back on the life of the average person was small. 
The Internet then gave access to billions and theoretically allowed for our personal moments to be captured “forever.” 
However centralized entities such as Facebook, Instagram, and Google are not forever. 
Web3 finally gives you the ability to capture moments that transcend time and fully own it too.

When minting an NFT in this project, you’re claiming a slot in the time capsule where you can showcase whatever you want to 
-- pics of family, memes, your Twitter profile, article screenshots, your favorite album cover --
whatever you want to remember forever.

The unique aspect of The Infinity Collections is that each NFT minted is a reflection of you, the owner. 
Essentially, each piece you own is piece of you that future generations can look back upon and remember who you were at this moment in time. 

Are you ready to be remembered?
